To whom it may concern,

Please find attached a revision of our paper "Ten Simple Rules for Writing a Technical Book".
We are grateful for the reviewers' comments, and have responded to them as indicated below.
We look forward to your decision on our paper.

Best regards,
Jess Haberman and Greg Wilson

Reviewer #1:

[01] "...the authors write that people still need "books". It might be nice to address the value of paper vs e-books (PDF etc) vs online Web sites..."
Explanation of the value of long-form explanations added.

[02] "...it's not clear books help with information being out of date..."
As above, we have clarified the role of books (long-form narrative, which is difficult to change day-to-day without losing continuity).

[03] "...'signing' seems like publisher specific jargon..."
Explained.

[04] "...'(trying) to change the world for the better' should be mentioned..."
Added.

[05] "Formatting!"
Yes, this was a Markdown-to-LaTeX conversion mistake - we believe we've corrected it.

[06] "don't write a reference book"
We believe authors and publishers *should* make books available as websites - people are going to fileshare them anyway.
However, publishers do still need something to sell.

[07] "...suggest making it 'differentiate yourself from prior work'..."
Agreed and incorporated.

[08] "...there's very little in this set of rules about design, structure, etc."
We felt this was too big a topic to offer advice on in this format, but we have recommended emulating successful book series.

Reviewer #2:

[09] "I'd like to see at least a line in the intro specify what it is that defines technical books"
Added.

[10] "I initially misread rule 2...the confusion could be partially alleviated by including a sentence with examples of what types of things to notice in other people's writing..."
Added

[11] "I found rule 6 to be both mildly amusing and vaguely irritating."
Toned down.

[12] "There's a lot of nuance in the subrules of rule 6"
Toned down.

[13] "I suspect the rules may be more comprehensible in a different order, perhaps presented chronologically"
We discussed this, but decided to leave the rules in the original order.

[14] "...what [would] the authors...recommend about the process of developing content?"
We've added a few clarifications throughout.

Reviewer #3:

[15] "Rule one title could be 'Identify your motives to write, writing for money should not be one of them.'"
We discussed this, but decided to keep the titles short.

[16] "I would also one more rule: Don't copy."
Added.
