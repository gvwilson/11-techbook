To whom it may concern,

Please find attached a revision of our paper "Ten Simple Rules for
Writing a Technical Book".  We have moved the footnote inline as
requested, and have attached LaTeX source (with inlined bibliography)
and PDFs of both the manuscript and the differences. Please let us
know if anything further is required.

Best regards,
Jess Haberman and Greg Wilson
